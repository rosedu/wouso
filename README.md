# World of USO
Hello, it's me

World of USO is a quiz game framework. It has been used since 2007 as a support game for the Introduction to Operating Systems class (USO) by 1st year students at the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest.

## Easy install

On a Debian-based system run the install script:

    ./install.sh

If everything installs succesfully go to step 9 to start the server.

## Requirements

The following packages need to be installed:

* python2.7
* python-pip
* python-django
* python-dev
* python-virtualenv
* libldap2-dev
* libsasl2-dev
* libssl-dev

On a **Debian-based** system run the command:

    sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-pip python-django python-dev python-virtualenv libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev

On a **Fedora 22** system run the command:

    sudo dnf -y install python-pip python-django python-devel python-virtualenv openldap-devel libgsasl-devel openssl-devel

On a **Fedora 21 or lower** system run the command:

    sudo yum -y install python-pip python-django python-devel python-virtualenv openldap-devel libgsasl-devel openssl-devel

In case of MySQL support:

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev


## Installing WoUSO

1. Fork/Clone the WoUSO repository from GitHub.

2. Browse to the Git repository and activate the virtualenv:

        cd $PATH_TO_WOUSO_REPOSITORY
        virtualenv -p python2.7 sandbox
        source sandbox/bin/activate

    `$PATH_TO_WOUSO_REPOSITORY` is the location of the clone of the WoUSO repository.

    You'll notice it works as you get a prompt update: the `(sandbox)` string is prefixed to the prompt. Something like:

        (sandbox)wouso@wouso-dev:~/wouso.git$

    In case you do something wrong in the virtualenv, you may exit it using

        deactivate

    and you may then remove the `sandbox` folder:

        rm -r sandbox

3. Install pip requirements while in the `$PATH_TO_WOUSO_REPOSITORY` folder:

        pip install -r requirements-pip
        pip install -r requirements-extra

4. Install `django-piston` for WoUSO REST API (by hand, because of a [weird bug](https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/issue/173/attributeerror-module-object-has-no)):

        curl 'https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/django-piston/django-piston-0.2.3.tar.gz' | tar xzf -
        cd django-piston-0.2.3; python setup.py install
        cd ..; rm -r django-piston-0.2.3


5. Go to `wouso` subfolder, run everything from there:

        cd wouso/

6. Create initial settings. First make a copy of example settings:

        cp settings.py.example settings.py

    and edit the new file (`settings.py`). You may want to update the `DATABASES` setting (see next step).

7. (optional) In case you want to use a MySQL database, you must have the MySQL server and client packages installed. For MySQL support in Python you can use `pip`:

        pip install MySQL-python

    Create the database and use and use appropriate settings. For example, one would issue these commands in the MySQL client prompt to create a database:

        create database wouso default character set utf8 default collate utf8_general_ci;
        create user 'wouso'@'localhost' identified by 'some_pass';
        grant all privileges on wouso.* to 'wouso'@'localhost';
        flush privileges;

    The appropriate database configuration in the `settings.py` file will then look like this:

        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
                'NAME': 'wouso',
                'USER': 'wouso',
                'PASSWORD': 'wouso',
                'HOST': 'localhost',
                'PORT': '',
            }
        }

8. Create database tables and load initial data:

        ./manage.py wousoctl --setup

    You will be requested for an username and password for the administrative user. You will use those to first login into World of USO and use full priviliges for administrative actions.

9. Run the server:

        ./manage.py runserver

    By default the server listens for connections on localhost port 8000. In case you want the server to listen on all interfaces, run

        ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

    You can now point your browser to an URL such as `http://localhost:8000` or `http://<IP>:8000/` (where `<IP>` is the IP address of the host where you installed World of USO).


If you want to leave the virtualenv, run

    deactivate


### Development Virtual Machine

In case you run into issues when installing/configuring World of USO or you just want a quick development/testing environment, you can grab the [development VM](https://github.com/rosedu/wouso/wiki/Development-VM).


### Using Vagrant

You may create a development environment using [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/). Make sure Vagrant is installed, then run

    vagrant up

You can now find a deployed version of WoUSO at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

All code is shared with the VM, which you can access using

    vagrant ssh

From there you can find the project files and interact with the django project as usual.
This also generated a superuser `admin:admin`.


## Development Best Practices

After pulling new code from server, while in sandbox mode, update the database schema by running the migration action:

    ./manage.py migrate

In case of issues, you may need to update the pip packages, by running the commands below while in the repository:

    pip install -r requirements-pip
    pip install -r requirements-extra
